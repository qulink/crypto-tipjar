      question: "What is a Lightning Address?",
      answer: "A Lightning Address is like an email address for Bitcoin. It allows people to send you Bitcoin instantly over the Lightning Network. Popular providers include Alby, Strike, and CashApp."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any fees?",
      answer: "Our widget is completely free to use. However, your Lightning wallet provider may charge small fees for receiving payments (typically 1-3%). Check with your wallet provider for their specific fee structure."
    },
    {
      question: "How fast do I receive tips?",
      answer: "Lightning payments are instant! You'll receive the Bitcoin in your wallet within seconds of someone sending a tip."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this safe to use on my website?",
      answer: "Yes, the widget is completely safe. It only displays a tip button and QR code - no sensitive information is processed through our servers. All payments go directly to your Lightning wallet."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the widget appearance?",
      answer: "Yes! You can customize the button text, color, and size. The widget is designed to blend seamlessly with your website's design."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to create an account?",
      answer: "No account needed! Just enter your Lightning address, customize your widget, and copy the embed code. It's that simple."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't have a Lightning wallet?",
      answer: "You'll need a Lightning wallet to receive tips. We recommend starting with Alby (web), Strike (mobile), or CashApp (US only) as they're beginner-friendly and provide Lightning addresses."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this on multiple websites?",
      answer: "Absolutely! You can embed the same widget on as many websites as you want. Each site will use the same Lightning address to send tips to your wallet."
